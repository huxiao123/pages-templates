# React ESR Template

ESR is a rendering technology performed on edge computing nodes, which are typically located closer to users geographically, enabling faster response to user requests. By combining the strengths of SSR and CSR, ESR can generate HTML pages on edge nodes and deliver them to clients.

This template is a React app that uses edge functions to render pages.
