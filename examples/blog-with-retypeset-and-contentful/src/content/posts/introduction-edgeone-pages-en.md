## **What is EdgeOne Pages?**

EdgeOne Pages is a static site hosting service powered by Tencent Cloud’s EdgeOne, offering a seamless solution for deploying and managing static web content. It enables developers to effortlessly host HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets while automating critical tasks like global content delivery, SSL certification, and version control. With EdgeOne Pages, users can focus on innovation rather than infrastructure, launching websites in minutes with zero operational overhead.

## **Core Features & Benefits**

### 1. **Lightning-Fast Deployment**

- **Git-Driven Workflow**

: Automatically sync with GitHub, GitLab, or other Git repositories to trigger instant builds and deployments upon code commits.


- **CLI Integration**

: Deploy projects directly from your local environment using the EdgeOne CLI with a single command (e.g.,**`edgeone deploy`**).


- **Drag-and-Drop Simplicity**

: Non-technical users can upload files or ZIP archives via an intuitive dashboard for quick publishing.



### **2. Global Edge Network for Unmatched Speed**

Leveraging Tencent Cloud’s distributed edge nodes, EdgeOne Pages ensures content is cached and delivered from the nearest location to users worldwide. Combined with HTTP/3 support and intelligent caching, this guarantees sub-second load times, even under high traffic or in regions with limited connectivity.

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade Security & Reliability**

- **Free SSL/TLS Encryption**

: All sites are automatically secured with HTTPS, protecting data integrity and user privacy.


- **Built-in DDoS Mitigation**

: Integrated edge security safeguards against volumetric attacks, ensuring uptime and stability.


- **Version Control & Rollbacks**

: Easily revert to previous deployments or test new releases with traffic-splitting for risk-free updates.



### 4. **Developer-Centric Tools**

- **Custom Domains & Routing**

: Connect your own domain and configure redirects, error pages (e.g., 404), or path-based routing rules.


- **Environment Variables**

: Manage dynamic configurations across development, staging, and production environments.


- **Real-Time Analytics**

: Monitor traffic, bandwidth usage, error rates, and performance metrics through a centralized dashboard.



## **Use Cases**

1. **Personal & Open-Source Projects**

Host portfolios, technical blogs, or documentation sites (built with tools like VuePress, Docusaurus, or MkDocs) without managing servers.

2. **Business & Marketing Sites**

Launch high-conversion landing pages, product showcases, or event microsites with global reach and instant scalability.

3. **Frontend Applications**

Deploy single-page applications (SPAs) built with React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte, optimized for fast initial loads via EdgeOne’s CDN.

4. **Testing & Prototyping**

Simulate APIs with static JSON responses or host mockups for streamlined collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

## **Getting Started in 4 Steps**

1. **Create a Project**

Log in to the EdgeOne console, navigate to “Pages,” and initialize a new project with basic details.

2. **Connect Your Repository**

Authorize GitHub/GitLab access or upload files manually to link your codebase.

3. **Configure Build Settings**

Define build commands (e.g., **`npm run build`**) and output directories (e.g., **`dist/`**). Save to trigger your first deployment.

4. **Map a Custom Domain**

Add a CNAME record in your DNS settings to point your domain to EdgeOne’s edge network.

Within minutes, your site will be live on a globally accelerated URL or your custom domain, ready to scale with your audience.
